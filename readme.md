#The Plan:

Everyday I will write a useful or not so useful script to help me learn more about python and become more familiar with the libraries. Feel free to comment on my work and give me suggestions and thoughts.

Day 1: sendlive - a script that sends your current directory to the default web dir making it easier for web dev to change between their many sites when coding.

Day 2: NetConfig - a script that helps with the automation of configuration of your primary nic if you need to use a static ip. (Primarily designed for CentOS 6.7)

Day 3: Investment Calculator - a script that uses your age and retirement age to figure out how much you will have if you stopped retirement contributions now

Day 4: UserStats - a very simple script that calls many of the useful logging
features that are already built in to CENTOS to help you monitor user activity
and login location and ip. 

Day 5: nanalysis - This script allows you to view packets in linux utilizing the socket library in python.

Day 6: pomTimer - This very simple script is a productivity timer and allowed me
to play around with timers in python

Day 7: httpServer - This simple http server utilizes scripts to serve webpages
and files.

Day 8: pscan - This script scans open ports on an entered host. Utilizes sockets
python module to scan

Day 9: DownAlert - This script will constantly monitor a host and a chosen port
for downtime and if the host or port goes down it will send a message to the
entered email address

Day 10: todo - This script allows the user to create a very simple todo list to
learn the use and functions of arrays.

Day 11: Budgeting(v1) - This is a start to a budgeting app current functionality
is only adding and removing transactions

Day 12: nanalysis - Added a timer to allow the user to specify how long the
packet scanner runs

Day 13: sshastart - Simple script to start ssh agent

Day 14: rothcal - Roth IRA Investment Calculator

Day 15: backup - Backup script that allows the user to select a directory to
backup and compresses the dir and moves it to the remote host of the users
choosing

DAY 16: mysqlconnect - This script was the start of connecting databases with my
script in the next few days I will be implementing a gui for this to add and
remove records

Day 17: mysqladd - This script connects to the database and then will ask the
user for input to enter into the database
Day 18: mysqlview - A simple script to print out information from the selected mysql
database.
